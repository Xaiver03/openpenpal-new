# CSP (Content Security Policy) Fix Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Critical Issues
- **object-src**: Changed from conflicting `['none', 'data:']` to `['self', 'data:']` to properly allow SVG data URLs
- **Added missing directives**:
  - `worker-src: ['self', 'blob:']` - Support for service workers
  - `child-src: ['self', 'blob:']` - Support for web workers
  - `frame-src: ['none']` - Explicitly block iframes
  - `manifest-src: ['self']` - PWA manifest support
  - `frame-ancestors: ['none']` - Prevent clickjacking

### 2. Removed Overly Permissive Rules
- **Removed wildcards** in connect-src:
  - ❌ `ws://*`, `wss://*`, `http://localhost:*`, `https://*`
  - ✅ Specific endpoints only: `http://localhost:8080`, `ws://localhost:8080`, etc.

### 3. Improved Security Headers
- **Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy**: Changed from `require-corp` to `credentialless` (less restrictive)
- **Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy**: Changed from `same-origin` to `same-origin-allow-popups` (for OAuth)
- **Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy**: Changed from `same-origin` to `cross-origin` (for CDN resources)

### 4. Added CSP Violation Reporting
- Created `/api/security/csp-report` endpoint
- Production CSP now includes `report-uri` directive
- Logs violations for monitoring and debugging

## Current Configuration

### Development
- Allows specific localhost ports (8080-8004, 3000-3001)
- Keeps `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` for Next.js compatibility
- No HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
- More permissive for development convenience

### Production
- Restricts to specific production domains
- Includes CSP violation reporting
- Enables HSTS with preload
- Still uses `unsafe-inline` (TODO: implement nonce-based CSP)

## Next Steps

### Short Term
1. Monitor CSP violation reports
2. Adjust policies based on actual usage
3. Test all features with new CSP

### Long Term
1. Implement nonce-based CSP to remove `unsafe-inline`
2. Remove `unsafe-eval` after code audit
3. Add Content Security Policy tests
4. Implement proper CSP report storage and alerting

## Testing the Fix

1. Clear browser cache
2. Restart the frontend server
3. Check browser console for CSP errors
4. Test WebSocket connections
5. Test API calls
6. Test static resource loading

The CSP is now properly configured to allow legitimate functionality while providing security benefits.
