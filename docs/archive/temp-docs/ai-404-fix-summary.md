# AI 404 Error Fix Summary

## Root Cause
The AI routes were **MISSING** from the Gateway configuration. The frontend uses the Gateway (port 8000) for all API calls, but the Gateway didn't know how to route AI requests to the backend.

## What Was Actually Happening
```
Frontend → Gateway (8000) → ❌ 404 (no AI route configured)
                          ↘️ Backend (8080) has AI routes but never reached
```

## The Fix
Added AI route configuration to the Gateway router:

```go
// setupAIRoutes 设置AI相关路由
func (rm *RouterManager) setupAIRoutes(group *gin.RouterGroup) {
    aiGroup := group.Group("/ai")
    aiGroup.Use(middleware.NewRateLimiter(60))
    
    // 转发所有AI请求到主后端服务
    aiGroup.Any("/*path", rm.proxyManager.ProxyHandler("main-backend"))
}
```

## Files Modified
1. `/services/gateway/internal/router/router.go` - Added AI routes configuration

## Result
✅ AI routes now work correctly through the Gateway
- `/api/v1/ai/daily-inspiration` - Working
- `/api/v1/ai/stats` - Working  
- `/api/v1/ai/inspiration` - Working

## Why This Kept Happening
We kept trying to fix the wrong things:
- ❌ API path mismatches (not the issue)
- ❌ Authentication problems (not the issue)
- ❌ JSON parsing (not the issue)
- ✅ Gateway route configuration (THE ACTUAL ISSUE)

## Lesson Learned
Always check the **entire request flow** from frontend to backend, including intermediate services like gateways!
