# OpenPenPal Database Index Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of database indexes in the OpenPenPal PostgreSQL database, focusing on key tables critical to application performance. The analysis identifies existing indexes, duplicate indexes, missing indexes, and provides optimization recommendations.

## Key Findings

### 1. **Existing Indexes Overview**

The database has **113 indexes** across the analyzed key tables, showing generally good index coverage:

#### Well-Indexed Tables:
- **letters** (18 indexes): Comprehensive indexing including composite and partial indexes
- **courier_tasks** (13 indexes): Excellent coverage for routing and status queries
- **letter_codes** (11 indexes): Well-indexed for tracking and scanning operations
- **couriers** (14 indexes): Good hierarchical and status-based indexing
- **users** (8 indexes): Proper coverage for authentication and role-based queries

### 2. **Duplicate/Redundant Indexes Found**

Three sets of duplicate indexes were identified that should be consolidated:

1. **courier_tasks table:**
   - `idx_courier_tasks_delivery_op_code` and `idx_courier_tasks_delivery_op` (both on delivery_op_code)
   - `idx_courier_tasks_pickup_op_code` and `idx_courier_tasks_pickup_op` (both on pickup_op_code)

2. **couriers table:**
   - `idx_couriers_managed_prefix` and `idx_couriers_managed_op_code_prefix` (both on managed_op_code_prefix)

**Impact:** These duplicates consume unnecessary storage space and slow down write operations.

### 3. **Missing Indexes**

Four foreign key relationships lack indexes, which could impact join performance:

1. `envelopes.design_id` → `envelope_designs.id`
2. `museum_items.approved_by` → `users.id`
3. `museum_items.source_id` → `letters.id`
4. `museum_items.submitted_by` → `users.id`

### 4. **Composite Indexes Analysis**

The database makes good use of composite indexes (31 found), particularly in:

- **courier_tasks**: Multi-column indexes for complex routing queries
- **letters**: Composite indexes supporting status/visibility/user queries
- **letter_codes**: Combined indexes for envelope and recipient tracking

### 5. **Partial Indexes Analysis**

24 partial indexes were found, showing sophisticated optimization for specific query patterns:

- Conditional indexes with WHERE clauses for non-empty values
- Status-specific indexes (e.g., active drafts, in-transit letters)
- Soft-delete aware indexes (WHERE deleted_at IS NULL)

## Detailed Index Inventory

### Users Table (8 indexes)
```sql
- users_pkey (PRIMARY KEY on id)
- idx_users_username (UNIQUE on username)
- idx_users_email (UNIQUE on email)
- idx_users_school_code (on school_code)
- idx_users_op_code (on op_code)
- idx_users_deleted_at (on deleted_at)
- idx_users_created_role (on created_at DESC, role) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
- idx_users_role_school_active (on role, school_code, is_active) WHERE is_active = true
```

### Letters Table (18 indexes)
Includes sophisticated composite and partial indexes for various query patterns:
- User-specific queries with status filtering
- OP code-based routing queries
- Draft management with soft delete support
- Reply chain tracking

### Credit System Tables
- **user_credits**: Unique index on user_id (optimal for 1:1 relationship)
- **credit_transactions**: Indexes on user_id, expires_at, is_expired, expired_at

### Courier System Tables
Extensive indexing supporting:
- Hierarchical courier relationships
- Zone and level-based queries
- Task routing and prioritization
- Status tracking with timestamps

## Recommendations

### 1. **Remove Duplicate Indexes** (High Priority)
```sql
-- Remove duplicate indexes
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_courier_tasks_delivery_op;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_courier_tasks_pickup_op;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_couriers_managed_prefix;
```

### 2. **Add Missing Foreign Key Indexes** (High Priority)
```sql
-- Add missing foreign key indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_envelopes_design_id ON public.envelopes (design_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_museum_items_approved_by ON public.museum_items (approved_by);
CREATE INDEX idx_museum_items_source_id ON public.museum_items (source_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_museum_items_submitted_by ON public.museum_items (submitted_by);
```

### 3. **Consider Additional Composite Indexes** (Medium Priority)
```sql
-- For credit transaction history queries
CREATE INDEX idx_credit_transactions_user_created 
ON public.credit_transactions (user_id, created_at DESC);

-- For user activity tracking
CREATE INDEX idx_users_active_created 
ON public.users (is_active, created_at DESC) 
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
```

### 4. **Index Maintenance Recommendations**

1. **Regular REINDEX**: Schedule periodic reindexing for heavily updated tables
2. **Monitor Index Usage**: Use pg_stat_user_indexes to track unused indexes
3. **Analyze Tables**: Run ANALYZE regularly to update query planner statistics
4. **Consider Partial Indexes**: For tables with skewed data distribution

### 5. **Performance Monitoring**

Set up monitoring for:
- Sequential scan ratios on key tables
- Index scan performance
- Index bloat percentage
- Query execution plans for critical operations

## Conclusion

The OpenPenPal database shows evidence of thoughtful index design with good coverage for most query patterns. The main opportunities for improvement are:

1. Eliminating the 3 sets of duplicate indexes
2. Adding the 4 missing foreign key indexes
3. Adding a composite index for credit transaction history queries

These changes would reduce storage overhead and improve query performance without significant risk. The existing use of partial indexes and composite indexes demonstrates a sophisticated approach to query optimization that should be maintained as the application evolves.
