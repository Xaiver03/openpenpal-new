# Shared Libraries - Zero Breaking Refactor

This directory contains shared code libraries that can be imported by all services without breaking existing implementations.

## Safety Principles

1. **No Deletion**: Never delete original files
2. **Dual Implementation**: Keep old + new code side by side
3. **Feature Flags**: Use environment variables to switch
4. **Gradual Migration**: One service at a time
5. **Full Rollback**: Can revert to original state instantly

```

## Migration Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Add shared libraries (no changes to existing code)
2. **Phase 2**: Update import paths gradually
3. **Phase 3**: Test thoroughly with feature flags
4. **Phase 4**: Remove old implementations (only after full validation)

## Safety Features

- All original code remains untouched
- New imports use full paths to avoid conflicts
- Environment variable `USE_SHARED_LIBS=true` to enable
- Each service can migrate independently
- Instant rollback by switching environment variable
