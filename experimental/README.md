# Experimental Code Directory

## FSD Architecture (Feature-Sliced Design)

This directory contains experimental implementations using Feature-Sliced Design pattern:

### `/fsd-architecture/`
- **features/opcode/**: Complete OP Code feature implementation
  - `service.go.disabled`: Core business logic
  - `integration.go.disabled`: Legacy adapter layer  
  - `migration.go.disabled`: Migration utilities
- **widgets/opcode-management/**: Higher-level widget combining features

These files represent a significant architectural experiment for potential future migration to Feature-Sliced Design pattern.

## Usage

These files are disabled but preserved for:
1. Architecture reference
2. Future FSD migration planning
3. Code pattern examples

## Status

- Files are disabled and not compiled
- Safe to examine and learn from
- May be reactivated in future architecture migration
